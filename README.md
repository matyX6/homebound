Server-Client software that enables user to effortlessly create and manage a secure home server without a static IP. By using SSH communication, it ensures all data transfers are encrypted and secure. The server periodically uploads its data, such as the external IP, to a gateway Git repository, from which clients can fetch the data to securely access home network from anywhere.

## Status

> [!NOTE]
> Homebound is currently in its early development stages. Although it offers a flawless and secure experience, it does not yet include a graphical user interface (GUI). Future updates aim to introduce a GUI for even easier home server configuration and nice remote client.

## Compatibility & Usage

Server is designed to run on any computer with a Bash environment. Its lightweight nature ensures it can operate efficiently on all PCs, including those costing just a few dollars.

While the client software currently shares the same compatibility as the server, the goal is to provide a GUI in the future. Therefore, it will be supported only on GUI versions of Linux, macOS, and Windows.
