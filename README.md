This server-client software enables users to effortlessly create and manage a secure home server without requiring a static IP. Utilizing robust SSH communication, it ensures all data transfers are encrypted and secure. The server automatically uploads its data, including the external IP address, to a remote git repository. Clients can then fetch this data to their local storage, providing smooth and secure access to the home network from anywhere.

## Status

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Homebound is in the early stages of development. While it provides a flawless and secure experience, it currently operates without a GUI.

## Compatibility & Usage

Server software is designed to run on any computer with a Bash environment. Its lightweight nature ensures it can operate efficiently on all PCs, including those costing just a few dollars.

While the client software currently shares the same compatibility as the server, the goal is to provide a GUI in the future. Therefore, it will be supported only on GUI versions of operating systems like Linux, macOS, and Windows.
